	<h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>

    <p>Time complexity is a computational measure that describes the amount of time an algorithm takes to run as a function of the length of the input. Analyzing this allows developers to create more efficient code, ensuring that applications remain responsive even as data scales upwards.</p>

    <p><b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the total amount of memory space required by an algorithm during its execution. For instance, an algorithm that creates a new list proportional to the size of the input is said to have a linear complexity, often denoted as O(n).</p>
